## âœ¨ I'm a Junior Games Programmer.
Hi, I'm Jonathan, I also go by "J". I'm Junior Games Programmer mostly working in Unity with C#. Carter Games is my indie brand to release bigger projects under, so a lot of my latest personal work is on there in one way or another. While professional work is private due to NDA's. Here you will find personal projects, game jams & some old university projects. 

### Contributions Calander
A lot of my contributions/commits don't show up as I often work in branches, so while it may look quiet down there, I'm making a lot more commits that are being shown. Also my day job is not on Github so those won't show either xD
