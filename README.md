## âœ¨ I'm a Junior Games Programmer.
Hi, I'm Jonathan, I also go be "J". I'm Junior Games Programmer mostly working in Unity with C#. Carter Games is my indie brand to release bigger projects under, so a lot of my latest personal work is on there in one way or another. While professional work is priavte due to NDA's. Here you will find personal projects, game jams & some old university projects.
